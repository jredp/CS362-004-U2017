Preface: This document is a file containing bug reports for two bugs found in the dominion.c code of Kelsey Helms
Based on template from here: http://noverse.com/blog/2012/06/how-to-write-a-good-bug-report/

**********************
**BUG 1: Smithy Card**
**********************
Title: Error 1 -  When playing the Smithy card, the cardEffect will discard the wrong card, or none at all
Classification: Minor to Critical - Usually no knowledge of failure, potential seg fault. If you have a 
 	card in your hand at the hand position of handPos+1, the bug will be minor and it will discard the wrong card
Platform: *nix Flip Servers (Specifically Flip 1)
Reproducable: Every time
Description:
	Summary: 
		The actual problem is that a card that is not the played Smithy is discarded. The next card in your hand is discarded, or none at all.		
		When I was running tests using my cardtest1.c and my randomtestcard1.c Smithy test code I noticed that the handCount was failing.
		I investigated the pre and post numbers visually, they seemed fine. However, when I reviewed the code in dominion.c, I noticed
		that the discard function was incorrect. This was a "stumbled upon" bug find while looking at other concerning information.
	What Happened:		
		As I mentioned before, this was a stumble upon bug find during the lookup of the function to compare the handcount. The player
		who is playing would have no idea that their card that has been discarded was the wrong card unless they checked their hand
		immediately after a card play. In other words, nothing happened that would tip the user off that this bug had happened.
		The results that happened were consistent errors in the tests for both cardtest1.c and randomtestcard1.c.
	What's the error:
		During the tests, the things that tipped me off were the errors with the handcount.
		The randomtestcard1.c test failed with the following information
			[FAILED]: Card Effect: HandCount Assert +3 drawn, -1 played
			 -->aft Hand Count: 391
			 -->aft DECK Count: 1
			 -->aft Discard Count: 381
			 -->aft Played Count: 1
		The cardtest1.c test failed with the following information:
			[---------- cardtest1.c (SMITHY)-----------]
			Current hand count: 0
			Current hand count: 1
			Current hand count: 2
			Current hand count: 3
			Current hand count: 4
			handCountBef: 5
			Current hand count: 5
			Current hand count: 6
			Current hand count: 7
			handCountAft: 7
			-->Test 1 failed. Did not draw Cards accurately.
			0 tests passed.
	Steps to reproduce:
		1. Compile and run the randomtestcard1.c and the cardtest1.c on the base clone code 
		2. Run Make rTests to compile the output for the random tests
		3. Review the randomtestcard1.out
		4. Run Make myTests to compile and run the card/unit tests
		5. Review the unittestresults.out
		
	Offending Code:
		[dominion.c code starting at line 674-681]
		//+3 Cards
	    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	    {
	        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
	    }
	    
	    //discard card from hand
	    discardCard(handPos+1, currentPlayer, state, 0);

	    Specifically, [ discardCard(handPos+1, currentPlayer, state, 0); ]
	    *handPos should be handPos and not handPos+1.

**************************
**BUG 2: Adventurer Card**
**************************
Title: Error 2 -  When playing the Adventurer Card, the result the treasure count in hand is net +1(should net +2)
Classification: Major - Player only has knowledge of error if reviewing hand cards. Major gameplay bug. 	
Platform: *nix Flip Servers (Specifically Flip 1)
Reproducable: Every time
Description:
	Summary: 
		This bug will net you a +1 treasure to your hand instead of a +2 when the Adventurer card is played. This issue happens 100%
		of the time.
	What Happened:		
		When I ran the randomtestadventurer test program, I noticed that the printout specifically said:
			-->BeforeTreasureCount: 58
			-->AfterTreasureCount: 59		
		The Card Effect test failed. Knowing the rules of the game and the effect the adventurer card should produce, I noted the error.
		**To see a screenshot, review Assignment-5.pdf attached.
	What's the error:
		During the tests, the things that tipped me off were the errors with the Before/After TreasureCount messages.
		The randomtestadventurer test failed with the following information:
			[FAILED]: Card Effect: HandCount Assert
			 -->aft Hand Count: 495
			 -->aft DECK Count: 426
			 -->aft Discard Count: 37
			 -->aft Played Count: 0
			 -->aft Action Count: 1
			 -->BeforeTreasureCount: 58
			 -->AfterTreasureCount: 59
			<----------CARD EFFECT----------->
			///  Init Game Failed     : 0
			///  Card Effect Failed   : 0
			///  Hand Count Failed    : 1000
			///  Treasure Cnt Failed  : 991
			///  All Card Count Failed: 0			
		The cardtest1.c test passed
			[This code should be refactored]
	Steps to reproduce:
		1. Compile and run the randomtestadventurer test on the base clone code of Kelsey Helms
		2. Run Make rTests to compile the output for the random tests
		3. Review the randomtestadventurer.out
		4. Note the difference between treasure after each test run of 1000 runs
		5. Note the errors in the Treasure Cnt section in the summary
		
	Offending Code:
		[dominion.c code starting at line 657-658]
		    while(drawntreasure<2){
		        if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1){//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
		            shuffle(currentPlayer, state);
		        }
		        drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
		        cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];//top card of hand is most recently drawn card.
		        if (cardDrawn == copper || cardDrawn == silver || cardDrawn == gold)
		            drawntreasure = drawntreasure+2;    <--------------

	    Specifically, [ drawntreasure = drawntreasure+2; ]
	    *If drawntreasure adds 2 each time, the while statement will be met after 1 hit of that branch
